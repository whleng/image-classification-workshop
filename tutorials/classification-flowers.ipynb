[Data augmentation](./data_augmentation.ipynb) takes the approach of generating additional training data from your existing examples by augmenting them using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.\n","\n","You will implement data augmentation using the following Keras preprocessing layers: `tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip`, `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`, and `tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom`.
